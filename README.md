# Visualizing-Student-Makerspace-Portfolios
Maker portfolios will be able to demonstrate what test scores cannot and therefore enable youth from traditionally underrepresented communities (based on socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity, disability, or other) to step beyond the constraints of academic testing standards and show off their abilities and voicesâ€”our ongoing research must focus on these audiences and exist within these settings. It is important to recognize and pay attention to what the field is doing, which audiences are served, and what gaps remain. As seen through the many different materials being used and the diversity of race and ethnic backgrounds of youth at these makerspaces, both the breadth and the current inclusively of making forms a firm foundation for future policy and educational efforts seeking to deepen learning in these spaces over time.
